inception-v1 imagenet pretrained model
temporal frame 5/25 original frames

ne postoje c3d pre trained?

lstm capturuje high level varijacije ali ne i fIne detail //zasto??

The flow stream has an
adapted input convolutional layer with twice as many input
channels as flow frames (because flow has two channels,
horizontal and vertical), and at test time multiple snapshots
are sampled from the video and the action prediction is averaged. 
This was shown to get very high performance on
existing benchmarks, while being very efficient to train and test.

i ovde se uzima 5 frameova 10 frames apart i za rgb i za flow
5x7x7 feature grid ????? kako 7 ??? koji se ubaci u inception-v1
